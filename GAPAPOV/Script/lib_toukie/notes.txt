Planned Features
___________

High Priority:
angle from retrograde (moon return) is very inaccurate (goes from 10 degrees to 350)

Med Priority:
changing incl and SMA even when staying in orbit around same planet
FIRST match Inclination THEN circularize (at start of script)


Low priority :
check if ship direction moves to fast mid burn and if so ABORT
make sure rendezvous with planets gives error
Work on warp speeds for different planets
for boot up procedure make sure each engine is at 100%
