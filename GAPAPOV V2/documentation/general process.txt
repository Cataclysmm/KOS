When making a lib or exe file use the TX_ prefix so the Dependencies script can pick it up
after the lexicon add brackets, here is an example:

global TX_lib_hillclimb_score is lexicon(
  "CircScore", CircScore@,
  "ApoapsisScore", ApoapsisScore@,
  "InclinationScore", InclinationScore@
).
local TXStopper is "[]".

The part of the lexicon after TX_ should be the same as the file name
