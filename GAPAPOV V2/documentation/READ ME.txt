When using multiple KOS processors tag all processors (what the tags are doesnt matter).
The 'parent' processor (first processor placed) will be considered as the main processor and the last processor will store as
many lib files as possible. Once the last processor is filled the second to last will be filled with lib files.
When using multiple KOS processors only use the bootup_T file for the parent processor. Dont give the other processors boot files.
The recommended storage space is around 100000.

MAKING FILES
Say you have a ship called Apollo 11, you'd need to make the folder "Apollo" under the missions_toukie folder.
Within that "Apollo" folder youd add "Apollo 11.ks"

Start mission files with:
TX_lib_dependencies["AllDepencies"](scriptpath()).

This is look for the TX_ prefix and will load the files needed. It also looks for the TX_ prefix
within the files its already looking in.

RUNNING FUNCTIONS

An example of running a function which is in another file looks like this:
TX_lib_precision_landing["ToTargetLatLng"](-36, 5).

After TX_ you have the file name.
in the brackets and quotation marks you have the function name
in the last brackets you have the function's parameters

The mission files test 01.ks is an example of how to this should work.
