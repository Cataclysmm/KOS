set Value1 to 0.
set Value2 to 5.
set Value3 to 10.
set Value4 to 15.
set Value5 to 20.

Let's say we want to put these values in a list we want to edit later we can put them into a list by typing the following:

set ValueList to list(Value1, Value2, Value3, Value4, Value5).
print ValueList.

This will show:
[0] = 0
[1] = 5
[2] = 10
[3] = 15
[4] = 20

As you can see the list goes from 0-4 instead of 1-5. So if you'd want to access Value3 you'd need to look for [2].
This can be done as follows:

print ValueList[2]. // shows 10

But let's say you want to print every item in the list you could do:

print ValueList[0]. // shows 0
print ValueList[1]. // shows 5
print ValueList[2]. // shows 10
print ValueList[3]. // shows 15
print ValueList[4]. // shows 20

But the problem with this is that you have to know how big the list is and it'd take up a lot space when dealing with big lists.

for Value in ValueList {
  print Value.
}
