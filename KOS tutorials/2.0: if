Now we know how to set certain text to a variable we can explore more stuff.
For instance 'if', this checks if a certain value matches the given value.

set x to 1.

if x = 1 {
  print "x is one".
}

You've probably noticed the curly brackets {}, after an if statement you don't need a period but you need these brackets.
You could cover the piece the code within the curly brackets with your hand and say: if 'x' is equal to 1, then do whatever
I covered with my hand. If statements can also be used for booleans:

set SomeVariable to true.

if SomeVariable = true {
  print "this is true".
} else {
  print "this is false".
}


Ofcourse the equals sign isn't the only symbol you can use, other symbols are:

equals to or bigger than
1 >= 1
2 >= 1

equals to or smaller than
1 <= 1
1 <= 2

is not equal to
1 <> 2

Back to the 'if' statement, say you're not sure if an 'if' statement will be true, you can use the 'else' statement.
The 'else' statement also requires curly brackets {}.

set x to 1.

if x = 2 {
  print "x is two".
} else {
  print "x isn't two".
}

Since x isn't 2, it skips whatever would happen if 'x' would be 2. And checks what else to do, which is to print "x isn't two".
You could expand this by using 'else if', which means that if the first 'if' statement isn't true then check the following 'if'
statement.

set x to 1.

if x = 2 {
  print "x is two".
} else if x = 1 {
  print "x is one".
} else {
  print "x isn't one or two".
}

This would print "x is one".
