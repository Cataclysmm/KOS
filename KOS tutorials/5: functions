Imagine you're driving in a manual shift car for with an instructor for the first time.
He helps you getting into first gear and tells you the following when you want to accelerate:

Let go of the gas pedal
Press in the clutch pedal
Shift the gear stick from first to second
Let go of the clutch pedal
Press in the gas pedal

After a while he tells you:

Let go of the gas pedal
Press in the clutch pedal
Shift the gear stick from second to third
Let go of the clutch pedal
Press in the gas pedal

Not long after that he tells you:

Let go of the gas pedal
Press in the clutch pedal
Shift the gear stick from third to fourth
Let go of the clutch pedal
Press in the gas pedal

Wouldn't it be easier if instead of telling you the entire procedure he'd tell you the following:

Shift from first to second

And after a after he tells you:

Shift from second to third

And not long after that he tells you:

Shift from third to fourth

As you can see you only need to know how to shift once (if you're a quick learner) and after that telling the whole process is
repetitive. The same goes for code in KOS, you might want to use a piece of code more than once without typing it out everytime.
This is called a function and functions often have parameters (similar to starting conditions).

Here's an example of a simple function:

Function OneThroughFivePrint {
  print 1.
  print 2.
  print 3.
  print 4.
  print 5.
}

Functions can have any name but avoid making functions and variables the same name as this will very likely cause problems.
A function will do anything that's inside of the curly brackets. To use a function type the following:

OneThroughFivePrint().

This will show:
1
2
3
4
5
